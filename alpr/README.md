# Automatic License Plate Detection (ALPD)

Followed this tutorial to get started with creating our ALPD model.

License plate dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection).

## Steps to train model

1. Navigate to this directory `cd alpd/`
2. Create a Python virtual environemnt `python3 -m venv myenv` where `myenv` is the name of the virtual environment and can be changed
3. Activate the python virtual environment `source myenv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install tesseract v4 by following the instructions in [this article](https://pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/17/opencv-ocr-and-text-recognition-with-tesseract/) (changes depending on OS)
